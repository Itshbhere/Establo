# 🌐 Establo: Multi-Backed Stablecoin on Solana

## Bridging the Gap Between Tokenized Real Estate & Stable Digital Currencies

Welcome to **Establo** — a groundbreaking DeFi protocol on the **Solana ecosystem**. Our stablecoin is uniquely backed by a combination of **70% USDT** and **30% tokenized real estate assets**, creating a highly secure and asset-backed digital currency with real-world value.

## 🧩 What Is Establo?

Real estate is the **most monetized real-world asset** globally, yet largely illiquid and underrepresented in DeFi. Establo introduces a **hybrid-collateralized stablecoin** backed by:

- **USDT (70%)**: Providing liquidity and short-term stability.
- **Tokenized Real Estate (30%)**: Real-world property digitized as tokens on Solana, providing long-term value backing.

This combination delivers **price stability, capital efficiency**, and **real-world utility**—creating a bridge between traditional finance and modern DeFi.
